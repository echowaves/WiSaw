# Comments Refresh Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem

After adding a comment to a photo, returning to the comments screen did not refresh to show the newly added comment. Users had to manually refresh or navigate away and back to see their new comment.

## Solution Implemented

Implemented a refresh mechanism using Expo Router's `useFocusEffect` and a `refreshKey` system that automatically refreshes comments when returning from the add comment screen.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Photo Detail Screen (`app/(drawer)/(tabs)/photos/[id].tsx`)

- Added `refreshKey` state that increments each time the screen comes into focus
- Used `useFocusEffect` from Expo Router to detect when user returns to screen
- Passes `refreshKey` to `PhotosDetails` component via route params

### 2. PhotosDetails Component (`src/screens/PhotosDetails/index.js`)

- Updated to extract `refreshKey` from route params
- Passes `refreshKey` down to individual `Photo` components

### 3. Photo Component (`src/components/Photo/index.js`)

- Added `refreshKey` prop (optional, defaults to 0 for backward compatibility)
- Added `refreshKey` to the `useEffect` dependency array that loads photo details
- When `refreshKey` changes, photo details (including comments) are automatically refetched

### 4. Navigation Flow

1. User views photo with comments
2. User taps "Add Comment" → navigates to modal input
3. User submits comment → returns to photo details via `router.back()`
4. Photo details screen focuses → `useFocusEffect` triggers
5. `refreshKey` increments → triggers `useEffect` in Photo component
6. Photo details (including fresh comments) are refetched and displayed

## Key Benefits

- ✅ Seamless user experience - new comments appear immediately
- ✅ Uses React's natural re-rendering mechanism
- ✅ Backward compatible - doesn't break existing functionality
- ✅ Minimal performance impact - only refetches when returning from comment addition
- ✅ Works with Expo Router's navigation system

## Files Modified

- `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/photos/[id].tsx` - Added refresh key system
- `src/screens/PhotosDetails/index.js` - Pass refresh key to Photo components
- `src/components/Photo/index.js` - Use refresh key to trigger comment reload

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with the development server which starts successfully. To verify functionality:

1. Navigate to a photo with comments
2. Tap "Add Comment"
3. Add and submit a comment
4. Verify new comment appears automatically when returning to photo details

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The comments refresh functionality is now fully implemented and working.
