# Shared Photo Comments Refresh Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem

The shared photo screen did not update after adding a comment. When users added a comment to a shared photo and returned to the photo view, the new comment was not visible, requiring manual refresh or navigation to see the new comment.

## Root Cause

The `PhotosDetailsShared` component had the same issue as the original `PhotosDetails` component before our fix:

- `useEffect` with empty dependency array (`[]`) that only ran once on mount
- No refresh mechanism when returning from comment addition
- Photo data was not reloaded when the screen came back into focus

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated SharedPhotoDetail Screen (`app/(drawer)/(tabs)/shared/[photoId].tsx`)

**Added Refresh Key System**:

```tsx
import { useFocusEffect } from 'expo-router'
import { useCallback, useState } from 'react'

const [refreshKey, setRefreshKey] = useState(0)

// Refresh comments when screen comes back into focus
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    setRefreshKey((prev) => prev + 1)
  }, []),
)
```

**Pass Refresh Key to Component**:

```tsx
<PhotosDetailsShared route={{ params: { photoId, refreshKey } }} />
```

### 2. Updated PhotosDetailsShared Component (`src/screens/PhotosDetailsShared/index.js`)

**Extract RefreshKey from Params**:

```javascript
const { photoId, refreshKey } = route.params
```

**Fixed useEffect Dependencies**:

```javascript
// Before:
useEffect(() => {
  loadPhoto(photoId)
}, []) // Only ran once

// After:
useEffect(() => {
  setItem(null) // Clear previous data
  loadPhoto(photoId)
}, [photoId, refreshKey]) // Re-runs when refreshKey changes
```

**Pass RefreshKey to Photo Component**:

```javascript
<Photo photo={item} key={item.id} refreshKey={refreshKey} />
```

## Technical Flow

1. **User Views Shared Photo**: Initial load with `refreshKey = 0`
2. **User Adds Comment**: Navigates to modal-input screen
3. **User Submits Comment**: Returns to shared photo screen via `router.back()`
4. **Screen Comes Into Focus**: `useFocusEffect` triggers
5. **RefreshKey Increments**: `refreshKey` changes from 0 to 1
6. **Data Refreshes**: `useEffect` re-runs due to `refreshKey` dependency
7. **Photo Reloads**: `loadPhoto(photoId)` fetches fresh data with new comments
8. **Photo Component Updates**: `refreshKey` passed to Photo component triggers photo details refresh

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Shared photos now behave the same as regular photo details
✅ **Immediate Feedback**: New comments appear instantly when returning from comment addition
✅ **No Manual Refresh**: Users don't need to navigate away and back to see their comments
✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Previous photo data is cleared before loading fresh data
✅ **Reliable Dependency Tracking**: useEffect properly tracks all dependencies

## Files Modified

- `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/shared/[photoId].tsx` - Added refresh key system and focus effect
- `src/screens/PhotosDetailsShared/index.js` - Updated useEffect dependencies and passed refreshKey to Photo component

## Testing

✅ No compilation errors
✅ Consistent with existing PhotosDetails refresh mechanism  
✅ Uses the same Photo component that already supports refreshKey

## Verification Steps

1. Navigate to a shared photo with existing comments
2. Tap "Add Comment"
3. Add a new comment and submit
4. Verify new comment appears immediately when returning to shared photo view
5. Verify existing comments are still visible
6. Verify photo data loads correctly

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The shared photo screen now properly refreshes comments after adding a new comment, providing the same user experience as the regular photo details screen.
