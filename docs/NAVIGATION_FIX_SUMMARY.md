# Navigation Fix: Chat and Friends Screen Back Buttons

## Problem

The app had navigation issues where:

1. Chat screen back button created circular navigation with Friends
2. Friends screen back button used `router.back()` which didn't always return to Photos list
3. Users could get stuck in navigation loops between Chat and Friends

## Solutions

### Chat Screen Back Button

Changed from:

```typescript
onPress={() => router.push('/friends')}
```

To:

```typescript
onPress={() => router.replace('/friends')}
```

**Why router.replace()?**

- Replaces chat screen with friends screen instead of pushing to stack
- Prevents circular navigation loops
- Maintains expected behavior: chat "goes back" to friends

### Friends Screen Back Button

Changed from:

```typescript
onPress={() => router.back()}
```

To:

```typescript
onPress={() => router.push('/(tabs)')}
```

**Why explicit navigation to /(tabs)?**

- Friends screen should always return to Photos list (home screen)
- Provides consistent, predictable navigation behavior
- Ensures users can always get back to the main app screen

## Result

- ✅ Chat back button always returns to Friends list
- ✅ Friends back button always returns to Photos list (home)
- ✅ No more circular navigation loops
- ✅ Predictable, consistent navigation flow

## Files Modified

- `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/chat.tsx` - Chat back button uses `router.replace('/friends')`
- `app/(drawer)/_layout.tsx` - Friends back button uses `router.push('/(tabs)')`
- `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Added chat screen to stack configuration

## Navigation Flow

```
Photos List (Home) → Friends → Chat
                  ↖          ↙
                   ← Friends ←
                  ↖
                   ← Photos List
```

The navigation is now consistent and predictable for users.
