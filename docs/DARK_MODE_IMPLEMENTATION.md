# Dark Mode Implementation - WiSaw App

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The dark mode feature has been successfully implemented in the WiSaw app with a theme switcher located in the drawer menu at the bottom.

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Core Infrastructure**

- ✅ **Theme State Management**: Added `isDarkMode` atom to global state (`src/state.js`)
- ✅ **Theme Storage**: Created persistent storage utility (`src/utils/themeStorage.js`) using SecureStore
- ✅ **Dynamic Theme System**: Extended theme system with light and dark variants (`src/theme/sharedStyles.js`)

### 2. **Theme System Architecture**

- ✅ **Light Theme**: Existing light theme preserved as `LIGHT_THEME`
- ✅ **Dark Theme**: New `DARK_THEME` with proper contrast and colors for dark backgrounds
- ✅ **Theme Function**: `getTheme(isDark)` function returns appropriate theme based on mode
- ✅ **Hook**: `useCurrentTheme()` hook for components to access dynamic theme

### 3. **User Interface**

- ✅ **Drawer Theme Switcher**: Added toggle button in drawer menu bottom section
  - Shows moon icon in light mode / sun icon in dark mode
  - Text: "Dark Mode" / "Light Mode"
  - Styled consistently with app theme
- ✅ **Dynamic Drawer Styling**: Drawer background and text colors adapt to theme
- ✅ **Persistent Preferences**: Theme choice saved and restored on app launch

### 4. **Component Updates**

- ✅ **App Initialization**: Theme preference loaded at app startup (`app/_layout.tsx`)
- ✅ **AppHeader Component**: Fully dynamic theming with proper contrast
- ✅ **Secret Screen**: Identity creation/update screen supports dark mode
- ✅ **Chat Screen**: Messaging interface adapts to theme with StatusBar handling
- ✅ **Feedback Screen**: User feedback form themed dynamically

## 🎨 Theme Colors

### Light Theme (Default)

- Background: `#ffffff`
- Text Primary: `#555f61`
- Card Background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)`
- Header Background: `#f8f9fa`

### Dark Theme

- Background: `#121212`
- Text Primary: `#FFFFFF`
- Card Background: `#1E1E1E`
- Header Background: `#1F1F1F`

## 🚀 Usage

### For Users:

1. Open the drawer menu (swipe from left or tap hamburger menu)
2. Scroll to the bottom of the drawer
3. Tap the "Dark Mode" / "Light Mode" button
4. Theme changes instantly and is remembered

### For Developers:

```javascript
// Import the theme system
import { getTheme } from '../../theme/sharedStyles'
import { useAtom } from 'jotai'
import * as STATE from '../../state'

// In your component
const [isDarkMode] = useAtom(STATE.isDarkMode)
const theme = getTheme(isDarkMode)

// Use theme colors
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: theme.BACKGROUND,
  },
  text: {
    color: theme.TEXT_PRIMARY,
  },
})
```

## 📱 Status Bar Handling

The StatusBar automatically adapts:

- Light mode: `dark-content` (dark text on light background)
- Dark mode: `light-content` (light text on dark background)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management

- Uses Jotai for reactive state management
- Theme state automatically triggers re-renders when changed
- Global state ensures consistency across all screens

### Storage

- SecureStore used for persistence (same as other user preferences)
- Graceful fallback to light mode if storage fails
- Theme loaded during app initialization

### Performance

- Dynamic styles created per component render (negligible performance impact)
- Theme switching is instant with no flashing
- Proper component memoization where needed

## 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ App builds successfully without errors
- ✅ No compilation warnings related to theme implementation
- ✅ Theme switching works instantly
- ✅ Preferences persist across app restarts
- ✅ All updated screens maintain functionality

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The foundation is now in place for:

1. **System Theme Detection**: Auto-detect device theme preference
2. **Scheduled Theme**: Auto-switch based on time of day
3. **Custom Themes**: Additional color schemes beyond light/dark
4. **Theme Animations**: Smooth transitions between themes
5. **Component Library**: Extend theming to all remaining components
