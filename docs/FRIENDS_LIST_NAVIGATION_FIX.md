# Friends List Navigation Stack Fix

## Problem

The back button on the Friends list screen was not working correctly after returning from a chat screen. Instead of properly popping the navigation stack, it was attempting to navigate back to the chat screen, creating a navigation loop.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by improper navigation methods being used in the chat screen:

1. **Friends List** uses `router.push()` to navigate TO chat screens ✅
2. **Chat Screen** was using `router.replace('/friends')` to navigate BACK to friends list ❌
3. **Friends Screen** uses `router.back()` for its back button ✅

The problem: `router.replace('/friends')` replaces the current navigation entry instead of going back in the stack, which corrupts the navigation history and causes the back button behavior to be incorrect.

## Solution

Changed all navigation calls in the Chat screen from `router.replace('/friends')` to `router.back()` to maintain proper navigation stack integrity.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Chat Route Header Navigation

**File**: `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/chat.tsx`

```tsx
// Before
<AppHeader
  onBack={() => router.replace('/friends')}
  title={currentDisplayName}
/>

// After
<AppHeader
  onBack={() => router.back()}
  title={currentDisplayName}
/>
```

### 2. Fixed Delete Chat Navigation

**File**: `src/screens/Chat/index.js`

```javascript
// Before
// Navigate back to friends list
router.replace('/friends')

// After
// Navigate back to friends list
router.back()
```

## Navigation Flow (After Fix)

1. **Friends List → Chat**: `router.push()` (pushes new route to stack) ✅
2. **Chat → Friends List**: `router.back()` (pops current route from stack) ✅
3. **Friends List Back Button**: `router.back()` (pops friends route from stack) ✅

## Benefits

✅ **Proper Navigation Stack**: Back button now works as expected
✅ **Consistent Navigation**: All screens use appropriate navigation methods
✅ **No Navigation Loops**: Users can navigate back properly through the app
✅ **Preserved Functionality**: All existing chat functionality remains intact
✅ **Better UX**: Natural navigation behavior that users expect

## Technical Details

### Existing goBack Function (Unchanged)

The chat screen already had a proper `goBack()` function that:

- Updates the friends list state before navigating
- Uses `router.back()` correctly
- Was being used by the old header implementation

### Navigation Methods Used

- `router.push()` - For navigating forward to new screens
- `router.back()` - For navigating back in the stack
- `router.replace()` - ❌ Removed (was causing stack corruption)

## Files Modified

1. `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/chat.tsx` - Fixed header back button navigation
2. `src/screens/Chat/index.js` - Fixed delete chat navigation

## Testing

✅ Navigate from Friends List to Chat - works correctly
✅ Use back button in Chat to return to Friends List - works correctly  
✅ Use back button in Friends List - now works correctly (pops stack)
✅ Delete chat functionality - navigates back correctly
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Navigation stack integrity maintained

The Friends List back button now works correctly and properly pops the navigation stack instead of creating navigation loops.
