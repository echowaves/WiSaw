# Friends Sharing UX Improvements

## Summary

Improved the friends sharing user experience to make it consistent with photo sharing in the WiSaw app.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Manual Share Button to Friends List

- **Location**: `src/screens/FriendsList/index.js`
- **Description**: Added a prominent share button to each friend item in the friends list
- **Features**:
  - Blue colored button with white share icon (consistent with photo sharing)
  - Shadow and elevation for visual prominence
  - Positioned before edit and delete buttons for logical flow

### 2. Removed Auto-Share on Friend Creation

- **Location**: `src/screens/FriendsList/reducer.js`
- **Description**: Made friendship sharing optional instead of automatic
- **Benefits**:
  - Users have control over when to share
  - Consistent with photo sharing behavior (manual action required)
  - Better user experience (no unexpected sharing)

### 3. Enhanced UI/UX Features

### 4. User Guidance
