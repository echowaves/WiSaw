# Pending Friends Delete Button Implementation

## Overview

Added a delete button to the FriendsList screen, specifically for pending friendships that have the "Share" button. This allows users to remove pending friendship requests before they are confirmed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Delete Button Styling

```javascript
pendingDeleteButton: {
  paddingHorizontal: 16,
  paddingVertical: 10,
  marginLeft: 0,
  borderRadius: 8,
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.15)',
  elevation: 15,
  zIndex: 15,
  shadowColor: '#dc3545',
  shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
  shadowOpacity: 0.3,
  shadowRadius: 4,
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: 'rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.3)',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  minWidth: 80,
  minHeight: 36,
},
pendingDeleteButtonText: {
  color: '#dc3545',
  fontSize: 11,
  fontWeight: '600',
  marginLeft: 4,
},
```

### 2. Updated Container Layout

Modified `shareButtonContainer` to display buttons side-by-side:

```javascript
shareButtonContainer: {
  marginTop: 8,
  alignItems: 'flex-start',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  gap: 8,
},
```

### 3. Added Delete Handler

```javascript
const handleDeletePendingFriend = async ({ friendshipUuid, contactName }) => {
  Alert.alert(
    'Remove Pending Friend',
    `Are you sure you want to remove the pending friendship with ${contactName}?`,
    [
      { text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' },
      {
        text: 'Remove',
        style: 'destructive',
        onPress: () => handleRemoveFriend({ friendshipUuid }),
      },
    ],
  )
}
```

### 4. Updated Import Statement

Added `Alert` to React Native imports for confirmation dialog.

## Implementation Details

### Visual Design

- **Consistent Styling**: Delete button matches the Share button design but with red color scheme
- **Red Color Scheme**: Uses `#dc3545` (Bootstrap danger red) for destructive action
- **Side-by-Side Layout**: Share and Delete buttons are displayed horizontally with 8px gap
- **Elevated Appearance**: Maintains the same shadow and border styling as Share button

### User Experience

- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions with clear confirmation message
- **Context-Specific**: Only appears for pending friendships (where Share button is shown)
- **Accessible**: Includes proper hitSlop and pressRetentionOffset for better touch targets
- **Consistent Behavior**: Uses the same `handleRemoveFriend` function as other delete operations

### Functionality

- **Pending Friends Only**: Delete button only appears for friendships where `isPending` is true
- **Confirmation Required**: Shows Alert dialog with friend's name before deletion
- **State Management**: Refreshes friends list after successful deletion
- **Error Handling**: Uses existing error handling from `handleRemoveFriend`

## UI Layout

```
Pending Friend Item:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Friend Name                         │
│ ⏰ Waiting for confirmation         │
│ [📤 Share] [🗑️ Delete]             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Confirmed Friend Item:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Friend Name                         │
│ Tap to chat                         │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Files Modified

- `src/screens/FriendsList/index.js` - Added delete button, styling, and handler

## Testing Scenarios

1. ✅ Delete button appears only for pending friendships
2. ✅ Delete button does not appear for confirmed friendships
3. ✅ Confirmation dialog shows friend's name correctly
4. ✅ Cancel button dismisses dialog without action
5. ✅ Delete button removes friendship and refreshes list
6. ✅ Error handling works for failed deletions
7. ✅ UI layout remains consistent with existing design

## Benefits

- **Better Control**: Users can manage pending friendships more effectively
- **Reduced Clutter**: Ability to remove unwanted pending requests
- **Intuitive Design**: Delete button appears only where it makes sense
- **Safe Operation**: Confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- **Consistent Experience**: Matches the app's design language and behavior patterns

The implementation provides a clean, safe way for users to manage their pending friendship requests while maintaining the app's existing design standards and user experience patterns.
