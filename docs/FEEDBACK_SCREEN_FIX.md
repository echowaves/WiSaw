# Feedback Screen Form Persistence Fix ✅

## Problem

The feedback screen was retaining the previously entered text when users revisited the screen after submitting feedback or navigating away and coming back.

## Root Cause

The component state (`inputText`, `isSubmitting`, `isFocused`) was persisted in memory without any mechanism to reset when:

1. User successfully submits feedback and returns to the screen
2. User navigates away and comes back to the screen

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Added useFocusEffect Hook**

```javascript
import { useFocusEffect } from 'expo-router'

// Clear form when screen comes into focus
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    // Reset form state when navigating to the screen
    setInputText('')
    setIsSubmitting(false)
    setIsFocused(false)
  }, []),
)
```

### 2. **Enhanced Submit Success Handler**

```javascript
// Success haptic and navigation
Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success)

// Clear the form
setInputText('')
setIsSubmitting(false)
setIsFocused(false)

router.back()
```

## Key Changes Made

### ✅ **Added Imports**

- `useFocusEffect` from 'expo-router'
- `useCallback` from 'react'

### ✅ **Added Form Reset on Focus**

- Form clears every time user navigates to the feedback screen
- Resets input text, submission state, and focus state

### ✅ **Added Form Reset on Success**

- Form clears immediately after successful submission
- Ensures clean state before navigating back

## Behavior Now

### 🔄 **Screen Navigation**

- **Fresh Visit**: Form starts empty ✅
- **Return Visit**: Form is cleared and starts empty ✅
- **After Submission**: Form is cleared before navigation ✅

### 📝 **User Experience**

- Clean, empty form every time user opens feedback screen
- No residual text from previous submissions
- Consistent behavior across all navigation scenarios

## Files Modified

- `/src/screens/Feedback/index.js` - Added focus effect and enhanced submit handler

The feedback screen now provides a clean, empty form experience every time users visit it, preventing confusion from previously entered text.
