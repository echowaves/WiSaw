# Unified Friendship Sharing Implementation

## Overview

The WiSaw app now features a unified sharing system for friendships that provides users with multiple sharing options through a single, intuitive modal interface.

## Unified Sharing Approach

Instead of having separate buttons for different sharing methods, the app now uses a **single "Share" button** that opens a modal with multiple sharing options:

### Share Options Modal

- **Share Link**: Traditional text-based sharing via native share sheet
- **QR Code**: Visual QR code generation with scanning capabilities

## Two Types of Friendship Sharing

### 1. Pending Friendship Sharing

**Purpose**: Share friendship invitations to create new friendships
**When to use**: When you want to invite someone new to become your friend
**Options available**:

- **Share Link**: Creates and shares friendship invitation link via text/message
- **QR Code**: Generates scannable QR code containing friendship invitation data

### 2. Confirmed Friendship Sharing

**Purpose**: Share existing friend data between your own devices
**When to use**: When you want to sync friend information across your devices
**Options available**:

- **Share Link**: Shares friend data link for cross-device synchronization
- **QR Code**: Generates QR code for quick friend data transfer

## User Interface

### Pending Friends

- **Share Button** (orange): Opens share options modal
- **Delete Button** (red): Removes the pending friendship

### Confirmed Friends

- **Share Button** (gray): Opens share options modal
- **Swipe Actions**:
  - Right swipe: Share options and edit actions
  - Left swipe: Delete option

## Share Options Modal Features

### Main Options Screen

- Clean, modern bottom sheet design
- Two primary sharing options with descriptive icons
- Context-aware descriptions based on friendship status

### QR Code Screen

- Large, scannable QR code display
- Share QR code link functionality
- Clear instructions for usage
- Back navigation to main options

### User Experience Flow

1. User taps "Share" button on any friend
2. Share options modal slides up from bottom
3. User chooses between "Share Link" or "QR Code"
4. For QR Code: Modal transitions to QR display with sharing options
5. User can share QR link or let others scan the code directly
