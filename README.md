# WiSaw
## What I Saw today
No registration, no sign in -- just open the app, start taking photos, and see what's posted by other people nearby today.

This is the most minimalistic social sharing possible, yet, it's probably the most relevant one as well. 

It's relevant in time and space. You only see what may potentially matter to you. You do not choose what you see. As such, you do not have to spend time and effort making connections, describing your profile etc. You just start using it. 

The feed will always stay relevant for your location and time. 

If you see something you do not like -- just delete it, which will have an effect of drastically increasing the quality of the content for everyone, reducing the noise.

This works best for events, large and small. Wedding or celebration party, at a beach or a park, student at a campus, or a conference attendee, or a group of fans at a football game -- these all will benefit from WiSaw and will definitely make it a lot more fun.
