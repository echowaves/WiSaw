# Edit and Delete Buttons Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully moved the edit and delete friend buttons from the FriendsList screen line items to the Chat screen header, improving UX by providing contextual actions where they're most relevant.

## Changes Made

### 1. Chat Screen Header (`app/(drawer)/(tabs)/chat.tsx`)
- **Added edit and delete buttons** to the header's `headerRight` section
- **Edit button**: Opens NamePicker modal for editing friend's name
- **Delete button**: Shows confirmation alert before removing friend
- **Styling**: Consistent with design system using appropriate colors and icons

### 2. Edit Friend Functionality
- **NamePicker integration**: Properly implemented `setContactName` function
- **State management**: Updates friends list after name change
- **Error handling**: Shows appropriate toast messages for success/failure
- **Navigation**: Maintains current chat context after editing

### 3. Delete Friend Functionality  
- **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **State management**: Refreshes friends list after removal
- **Navigation**: Returns to friends list after successful deletion
- **Error handling**: Shows appropriate feedback for failures

### 4. FriendsList Cleanup (`src/screens/FriendsList/index.js`)
- **Removed unused styles**: 
  - `actionButtons`
  - `actionButton` 
  - `editButton`
  - `deleteButton`
- **Navigation**: Continues to pass `friendshipUuid` parameter to Chat screen

## Implementation Details

### Edit Flow
1. User taps edit button in Chat header
2. NamePicker modal opens with current friend name
3. User enters new name and saves
4. `setContactName` function calls friends helper
5. Friends list state is refreshed
6. Success toast is shown

### Delete Flow  
1. User taps delete button in Chat header
2. Confirmation alert appears
3. If confirmed, `handleRemoveFriend` function executes
4. Friend is removed via friends helper
5. Friends list state is refreshed
6. User is navigated back to Friends list
7. Success toast is shown

### Navigation Parameters
- Chat screen receives: `chatUuid`, `contact`, `friendshipUuid`
- `friendshipUuid` is used for edit/delete operations
- Proper JSON parsing of contact name for display

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Contextual actions**: Edit/delete available where chat is active
- **Reduced visual clutter**: FriendsList is cleaner without buttons
- **Better accessibility**: Actions are in expected header location
- **Immediate feedback**: Toast messages confirm operations

### Code Quality
- **Centralized logic**: Edit/delete logic in one place
- **Proper error handling**: Graceful failure management
- **State consistency**: Friends list always up-to-date
- **Clean separation**: Navigation vs action concerns separated

## Files Modified
- `app/(drawer)/(tabs)/chat.tsx` - Added edit/delete buttons and logic
- `src/screens/FriendsList/index.js` - Removed unused button styles

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Edit friend name** from chat screen
2. **Delete friend** with confirmation
3. **Cancel delete** operation  
4. **Network error scenarios** for both operations
5. **Navigation flow** after each operation
6. **State consistency** after operations

The migration maintains all existing functionality while providing a better, more intuitive user experience.
