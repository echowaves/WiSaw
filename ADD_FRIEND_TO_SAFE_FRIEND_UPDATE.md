## Implementation Details

### What Was Changed

- **Button Label**: "Add a Friend" → "Safe Friend"
- **Empty State Text**: "Add your first friend" → "Safe your first friend"

### What Was Not Changed

- Function names (`handleAddFriend`, `triggerAddFriend`, etc.) - preserved for code consistency
- Variable names (`addFriendButton`, `addFriendButtonText`) - preserved for style naming consistency
- Comments and technical references - preserved for developer understanding

## Files Modified

- `src/screens/FriendsList/index.js` - Updated user-facing text only

## User Experience

- **Consistent Terminology**: Now uses "Safe Friend" terminology throughout the UI
- **Same Functionality**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Better Clarity**: The term "Safe" may better convey the security/privacy aspect of the friendship system

## Technical Notes

- No breaking changes to the codebase
- All existing function calls and state management remain intact
- Only user-visible text was modified to maintain code stability
